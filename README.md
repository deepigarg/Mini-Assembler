## 1) About the Assembler
A basic implementation of a two-pass assembler, used to convert assembly language code to
object code.

1.1) Key features

● The assembler supports the use of labels, handles forward and backward referencing of
labels.

● The assembler handles variables and their memory allocation.

● Handles MACRO definitions and calls in the program

## 1.2) Machine requirements

● 12-bit accumulator architecture (Word length = 12 bits).

● Has at least 2

8 bit memory

## 1.3) Working

### First Pass:

The assembler in the first pass initialises a location counter and traverses the Assembly code line by
line, incrementing for each instruction.
It checks if the statement is a valid memory referencing instruction or a MACRO definition. It reports an
error in case it is none of these.
It creates a Label table to store the addresses of all Labels used in the program.
It creates a Symbol table to store addresses of variables used.
A Macro table is created to save the macro definitions.
The Macro calls are expanded during the first pass of the assembler, where the virtual parameters are
replaced by the actual parameters.
Multiple definitions for the same label are caught during the first pass and reported as an error.
References to undefined labels are caught after the first pass.
On encountering an error, the first pass continues and reaches the end, thus reporting all errors in the
program in one go. Following this, the execution is stopped and the user needs to correct the code and
run the assembler again.

### Second Pass:

The assembler reads the instructions one by one and converts opcodes and addresses to binary.
The label calls are replaced by the starting address of label definitions and variables are replaced by
their storage addresses, both provided by the location counter during the first pass.

## 2)Instruction Set
The instruction set is as follows:

## 2.2) Assembler Directives
### START statement
Optional;
First line of the Program;
Specifies a specific memory address to load the program at (StartAddress);
Generates error if used in any other line other than line 1

Syntax: START StartAddress

### END statement
Optional;
Indicates the End of the program;
Lines After this statement are not translated.

Syntax: END

## 3) General instruction format

### 3.1) Syntax
<LabelName:> Opcode <Operand> <Comment>
  
### 3.2) Label name
Optional;
Should only start with a letter;
Cannot be an opcode;
Cannot contain spaces;
Label name should be followed by a colon “:”

### 3.3) Opcode
Should be in the same case (Uppercase) as mentioned in the table;
Should be followed by the correct number of operands as mentioned in the table

### 3.4) Operands

#### 3.4.1) Variable Names
Variable Names:-Should begin with a letter only;
Cannot consist of spaces;
Cannot be Opcodes;
Cannot be reserved words (namely R1, R2);
  
#### 3.4.2) Memory addresses
Value can range from 0 to 255
  
#### 3.5) Comments
Optional;
Only single line comments supported;
Comment should begin with “//”
  
## 4) MACRO definition
Syntax: MacroName MACRO <Parameter1 Parameter2 ..>
  
... <MACRO body> ...
  
MEND
  
Parameters (Space separated) are variables and follow the same convention as other variables;
The MACRO body should not contain Labels or references to labels;
  
MACRO CallSyntax: MacroName <Parameter1 Parameter2..>
  
## 5) Providing the input file
A TEXT FILE consisting of Assembly language program saved in the same directory as
the assembler program with the name given below.
  
File Name: “input.txt”
  
## 6) Output file format
A Text File containing the Machine Language program corresponding to the Input
Assembly Program is created in the same directory as the Assembler program.
  
File Name: “output.txt”
  
The first 4 bits of each instruction constitute the opcode and the rest 8 bits define the address of
the operand.
  
## 7) Errors and Warnings
### Errors:
Errors abort the execution of the program after the first pass is complete. The tables are displayed
but the output file is not created. The user is required to rectify the error in order to translate their
program successfully.
  
### Warnings:
Warnings are displayed at points where the assembler detects a possible error in the user’s logic
like a missing CLA (clear accumulator) instruction in the input code. It should not be seen as an
error as output code file is successfully created.
